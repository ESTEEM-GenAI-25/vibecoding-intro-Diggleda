      "I am devoted to non-duality and love. I am the fifth generation of the Walsh Construction family, an electrical engineer from the University of Notre Dame, and passionate about entrepreneurship. My greatest weakness is self-sabatoging and limiting my connection to Source, which I am quickly realizing never was severed.",

        "Drapery Reveal™ is a site I am making available for everyone to use. Back in undergrad, I had a 3D model I made for a class project. I also had to make a presentation for this project, and wanted a good looking way to unveil the model. I figured out I would have to learn blender, and therefore, everyone else would too for something that really should be easier. It has evolved into what you see here today, a customizable scene-based unveiling animation. You can use your own textures, colors, and environment settings!",
